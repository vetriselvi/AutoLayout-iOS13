# Auto Layout 

Auto Layout allows us to set rules as to how we want our views to be displayed. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout all the elements in the storyboard onto the display. These rules allow our UI elements to be resized and positioned so that no matter which screen they are displayed on or on screens with different aspect ratios.
